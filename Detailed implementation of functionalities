General Business Strategy:
The main objective is to connect farmers and ranchers with consumers looking for fresh, quality produce. By providing a platform that facilitates this connection, it is expected to increase sales for farmers and ranchers, offer more competitive prices to consumers, and promote local consumption.
For the marketplace to be sustainable, it could consider charging commissions for each sale made through the platform or having a subscription model for sellers. It is also vital to ensure trust in the platform through robust review and rating systems, as well as clear return and refund policies.
Over time, as the marketplace grows, consideration can be given to expanding into new categories, introducing advanced tools (such as AI for recommendations) and strengthening the community through education and sustainability programs.



7. Ratings and Reviews:
- Requirements:
- Consumers should be able to rate and leave reviews on products and vendors.
- A moderation system should be in place for inappropriate reviews.
- Logic:
- After a purchase, the consumer is invited to rate and review the product and seller.
- Ratings and reviews are visible to other users, helping in their purchasing decisions.
- Inappropriate reviews can be reported for review and possible removal.
8. Messaging:
- Requirements:
- Allow direct communication between consumers and sellers.
- Notification system for new messages.
- Logic:
- A consumer can send a direct message to a seller to ask questions or clarify details about a product.
- Both the consumer and the seller receive notifications of new messages.
9. Notification System:
- Requirements:
- Notify users of relevant activities: new messages, order status changes, promotions, etc.
- Logic:
- Notification is generated based on specific events on the platform.
- Users can view and manage their notifications from their profile.
10. Order Management:
- Requirements:
- Sellers must be able to view and manage orders: accept, reject, update status (e.g., in preparation, shipped, delivered).
- Consumers must be able to view the status of their orders.
- Logic:
- Once an order is placed, the seller receives a notification.
- The seller can manage the order, and each status change is notified to the consumer.
