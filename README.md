E-commerce Website Development Requirements:
I'll tell you what the project consists of right now: I'll give you an example, it's like the little stalls of farmers and ranchers in the US selling their products the same thing but online, this being a market instead of physical, so digital.


Backend (Python and Django):

<!-- Window Users -->
Clone and cd into repository
Create a venv folder using: python -m venv venv
Activate venv on window terminal using: venv\scripts\activate
Run this command to install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


<!-- Mac/Linux Users. If not clear please search the web for how to create virtual environment for a python environment using mac/linux  -->
Clone and cd into repository
Install virtualenv using: pip install virtualenv
Create venv using: virtualenv venv
Activate venv using: source venv/bin/activate
Run this command to install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
	

The Project root is the core folder where you will find the settings.py file and other relevant files for this project.

The authUsers is a separate app to manage Users (i.e Create, Edit, Delete etc...)

The chatapp is a separate app where websocket will be used for routing rather than http or https. It will be a simple chat app for this project.

The notifications app is a separate app for managing notifications.

The products app is a separate app for managing products (i.e Create, Edit, delete etc...)

Note: If there are apps you would like to create, for example the payment system app, please go ahead if you know what you are doing. Thanks.
