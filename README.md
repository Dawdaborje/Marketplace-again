General Business Strategy:
The main objective is to connect farmers and ranchers with consumers looking for fresh, quality produce. By providing a platform that facilitates this connection, it is expected to increase sales for farmers and ranchers, offer more competitive prices to consumers, and promote local consumption.
For the marketplace to be sustainable, it could consider charging commissions for each sale made through the platform or having a subscription model for sellers. It is also vital to ensure trust in the platform through robust review and rating systems, as well as clear return and refund policies.
Over time, as the marketplace grows, consideration can be given to expanding into new categories, introducing advanced tools (such as AI for recommendations) and strengthening the community through education and sustainability programs.
